Compatible with: GTA V 1.0.3095+ & FiveM (latest artifact)

## Why QuantV is still the top choice in 2025

Even after all these years, QuantV continues to deliver one of the best balances between visual quality and performance. Here's why thousands of players still prefer it:

- Extremely realistic day/night cycle with natural color grading
- Beautiful godrays, volumetric fog, and lens flares
- Deep, accurate reflections on cars, roads, puddles and windows
- Great water physics and caustics (especially in rain)
- Works flawlessly in FiveM (client-side only — no server-side installation needed)
- Regular updates — new versions released every few months with improved compatibility
- Huge community support — preset tweaks, alternative versions, and fixes shared daily on Reddit and Discord

Compared to newer presets like NaturalVision Evolved (NVE) or Redux, QuantV often wins in:
- Lower performance impact on mid-range PCs
- Better compatibility with FiveM servers
- More natural look (less "over-sharpened" or "cartoonish" than some competitors)

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide (2025)

### For GTA V Singleplayer (Rockstar Launcher / Steam)

1. Download the archive using the button above
2. Extract all files using WinRAR / 7-Zip
3. Disable your antivirus temporarily (or add exception for the folder)
4. Copy **everything** from the extracted folder into your GTA V main directory  
   (the folder where GTA5.exe is located)
5. Launch the game normally
6. First launch may show ReShade/ENB setup window — accept default settings
7. Done! Enjoy dramatically improved graphics

### For FiveM (Online servers)

1. Download and extract QuantV as described above
2. Copy the files into your FiveM application data folder:  
   `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\data\`
   OR directly into your server resources folder if you run your own server
3. Start FiveM and join any server
4. QuantV loads automatically (client-side visual mod)

**Important notes for FiveM:**
- Most servers allow client-side visual mods (QuantV is cosmetic only)
- If a server bans visual mods — use it only in singleplayer or friendly servers
- For best performance: disable MSAA, set VSync to half or off

## Performance Tips & Known Issues (2025)

**Recommended settings for smooth 60+ FPS:**
- Texture Quality: Very High
- Shader Quality: Very High
- Shadow Quality: High or Very High
- Reflection Quality: Ultra
- MSAA: Off (use FXAA or TXAA instead)
- Extended Distance Scaling: 50–70%
- Population Density/Variety: 80–100%

**Common fixes:**
- Game crashes on launch → delete d3d11.dll & dxgi.dll from game folder
- Black screen → disable ENB series in enblocal.ini (set EnableProxyLibrary=false)
- Low FPS → lower PostFX and Anisotropic Filtering to High
